## Code Ocean Python SDK Version Compatibility

Each release of this Code Ocean Python SDK is tested and verified against a specific minimum version of the Code Ocean platform API.
Generally, this minimum version is the latest Code Ocean version at the time of the SDKâ€™s release.
We recommend ensuring your SDK dependency is pinned to a version compatible with your Code Ocean deployment.
For details on when the minimum Code Ocean platform version changes, see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
