# Code Ocean Python SDK Version Compatibility

Each release of this Code Ocean Python SDK is tested and verified against a specific minimum version of the Code Ocean platform API. Generally, this minimum version is the latest Code Ocean version at the time of the SDK’s release.
We recommend ensuring your SDK dependency is pinned to a version compatible with your Code Ocean deployment.
